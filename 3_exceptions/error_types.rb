#If you want your user to be able to distinguish different failure types 
# (perhaps to handle them differently), you can extend StandardError 
# and write your own:

class EngineStalledError < StandardError
end

class CollisionOccurredError < StandardError
end

def drive_car
  # engine may stall, collision may occur
end

begin
  drive_car
rescue EngineStalledError => e
  puts "Rescued from engine stalled!"
rescue CollisionOccurredError => e
  puts "Rescued from collision!"
ensure
  puts "Car stopped."
end
